      </div>
      <h4>Miromatrix Medical, Eden Prairie, MN</h4>
      <p>Weekend technician for a small R&amp;D laboratory focused on developing bio-engineered kidneys (BEKs) and livers (BELs).
      <ul>
        <li>Performed husbandry on BEK/Ls in support of primary research; such tasks included (but not limited to) contamination checks, 3D media changes, cell seedings (HUVECs and primary kidney cell isolates or cultures for BEKs) and formalin fixation for sectioning and imaging.</li>
        <li>Independently managed team and facility activities on the weekends, such as primary cell culture (media changes and subpassaging), fixation of cells for immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry, and general lab husbandry such as restocking, autoclaving resusables and biohazardous materials, and data logging.</li>
        <li>Assisted in training new technicians and scientists on assays geared toward bioengineered organ production, which required writing and revising SOPs to comply with current and experimentally-backed practice.</li>
        <li>Participated in inter-departmental projects and activities in support of broader R&amp;D objectives, such as the development and testing of a new bioreactor, setups for <i>ex vivo</i> blood perfusion systems, and surgically invasive patency tests.</li>
